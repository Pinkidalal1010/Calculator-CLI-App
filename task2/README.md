# 📝 To-Do List Application (Console-Based)

## 📌 Project Overview

This is a simple **To-Do List Manager** built using **Python**.
It allows users to **add**, **view**, and **remove** tasks directly from the **command line interface (CLI)**.
All tasks are stored in a **text file (`tasks.txt`)**, making them persistent between program runs.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To implement a basic console-based application that demonstrates:

* File handling in Python
* List operations
* String manipulation
* Data persistence using text files

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Editor:** VS Code / Terminal
* **File Handling:** open(), read(), write()

---

## 🚀 Features

✅ Add new tasks
✅ View existing tasks
✅ Remove completed tasks
✅ Automatically saves and loads tasks from `tasks.txt`

---

## 🧩 How It Works

1. **Run the program:**

   ```bash
   python todo.py
   ```

2. **Choose an option:**

   ```
   1. View Tasks
   2. Add Task
   3. Remove Task
   4. Exit
   ```

3. **All changes** are saved automatically when you exit the app.

## 📂 File Structure

```
ToDo-List-App/
│
├── todo.py         # Main Python script
├── tasks.txt       # File storing tasks
└── README.md       # Project documentation
```

## 🧠 Key Concepts Used

* **File Handling** – Using `open()`, `readlines()`, `write()`
* **Lists** – For storing tasks temporarily in memory
* **String Manipulation** – Using `.strip()` to remove unwanted spaces
* **Loops & Conditionals** – For menu-based interaction
* **Persistence** – Saving and retrieving tasks from a file

## 💡 Sample Output

```
===== TO-DO LIST MENU =====
1. View Tasks
2. Add Task
3. Remove Task
4. Exit
Enter your choice (1-4): 2
Enter new task: Finish Python Internship Task
✅ Task 'Finish Python Internship Task' added.
```
